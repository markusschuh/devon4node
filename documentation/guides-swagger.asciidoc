= Swagger

We can use swagger (OpenAPI) in order to describe the endpoints that our application exposes.

NestJS provides a module which will read the code of our application and will expose one endpoint where we can see the swagger.

Add swagger to a devon4node application is simple, you only need to execute the command `devon4node generate swagger` and it will do everything for you. The next time that you start your application, you will be able to see the swagger at `/v1/api` endpoint.

The swagger module can read your code in order to create the swagger definition, but sometimes you need to help him by decorating your handlers.

For more information about decorators and other behaviours about swagger module, you can see the link:https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/swagger[NestJS swagger documentation page]

NOTE: the OpenAPI specification that this module supports is v2.0. The OpenAPI v3.0 is not available yet by using this module.
